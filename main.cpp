Description: This program is an easy Math Tutor. It is a program that is intended to
             help small children do simple math problems. This program will ask the
             user to enter their name, and then ask them a math question until they
             don't want more. The math program is able to tell if the input is a
             number or not. It does all 4 math operations to help kids in all math
             aspects. This program also levels up every three correct answers and
             levels down every three wrong answers. After every question, the program
             will ask the user if they want to continue. The program will only end when
             the user says that they want to stop.
